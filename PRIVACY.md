# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: 2026-02-09

## 1. Data Collection
**We collect nothing.**
*   QBIT does not have a central server.
*   We do not know who you are, who you talk to, or when you talk.
*   The app does not include analytics, crash reporting (Crashlytics), or trackers.

## 2. Local Data
*   All messages, contacts, and keys are stored **locally** on your device.
*   If you lose your device/PIN, your data is lost forever. We cannot recover it.

## 3. Network Routing
*   Messages are routed through volunteer SMP relays.
*   Relays see only encrypted packets and do not know the sender or receiver identity (onion routing concept).

## 4. Permissions
QBIT requests the absolute minimum permissions:
*   `INTERNET`: To send/receive packets.
*   `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`: To keep the connection alive.
*   `CAMERA` (Optional): For scanning QR codes.
*   **REMOVED**: `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (We do not access your public files).
